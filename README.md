# SSMRB - Project #3


# Week One Deliverables

## *__Project Definition and Value__*

### Our team was approached by All Media Painters in McMinneville, Oregon who were interested in a website for their painting group. The artists in the group meet weekly to work on art together and also independently take commissions for artwork. 

### Our team decided to develop an app for a wider audience, while meeting the needs of AMP-McMinneville. This fills a need in the art community for small painting groups or independent artists to:

1. Easy plug and play portfolio.
2. Community visibility for local artists.
3. Communication of events and tips/tricks for different artistic mediums.
3. Location for artists to make contacts for commission work.
