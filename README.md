# SSMRB - Project #3


# Week One Deliverables

## *__Project Definition and Value__*

### Our team was approached by All Media Painters in McMinneville, Oregon to develop a website for their painting group. The artists in the group meet weekly to work on art and occaisionally individual members accept commissions for custom artwork. 

### Our team decided to scale the app to serve a wider audience, while meeting the needs of AMP-McMinneville. The app will support the art community meeting needs for small groups or independent artists to:

1. Upload images into standard portfolio to showcase their art.
2. Provide community visibility for local artists.
3. Facilitate communication of events.
4. Community for sharing tips and methods for varied artistic mediums.
3. Create a location for artists to make contacts for commission work.
